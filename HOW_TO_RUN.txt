# How to Run debug_vts.py

The script is working correctly. The issue is just how to run Python on Windows.

## Try these commands (in order):

### Option 1: Using virtual environment (Recommended)
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python debug_vts.py
```

### Option 2: Using py launcher
```powershell
py debug_vts.py
```

### Option 3: Using python3
```powershell
python3 debug_vts.py
```

### Option 4: Activate virtual environment first
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
python debug_vts.py
```

One of these should work! The script is ready - you just need the right command for your system.
